<h1>TASK 1</h1>
<h3>Installation of RISC V toolchain was done successfully.</h3>
<h3>The task was to compile a C code that counts the sum of numbers from 1 to n and to run this program using a RISC V simulator.</p>
</h3>
<p>Firstly,I installed the text editor Leafpad using the command 'sudo apt-get install leafpad'</p>
<p>Then,using the command 'leafpad sum1ton.c',I created a file in leafpad to write the following C code which calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n:</p>

<br />
<p>I ran the program for n=5 using the following commands and obtained the result as expected:</p>

<br />
<p>I ran the program again but with n=100</p>
